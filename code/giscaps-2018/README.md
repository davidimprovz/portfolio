**What**: A simple data science app that evaluates Hawaii County properties to identify parcels with a likelihood of profitability. 

**How**: The app derives a machine learning model from past sales history and broader economic conditions. The model is used to assign a likelihood of sales outcome (profitable v. unprofitable) for each parcel.

**Use Case**: Allows a generic investor with no prior knowledge of a market to quickly determine a property's likely economic status, lowering the information barrier of entry to a real estate market.

Steps

1. Acquire data

2. Inspect data distributions

3. Create machine learning (ML) model

4. Run ML model backtest and make current status predictions

5. Display properties in a map, symbolized by likelihood of profitability
