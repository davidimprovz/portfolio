	Control logic for daily stock

	Steps
	----- 
	1. instantiate class, set variables,

	2. get the current NASDAQ downloaded 
	stock list.
	
	3. rename tickers in the DB as needed

	4. update price history for all unchanged
	stocks.

	5. update the DB AllStocksKey table with
	any new tickers using compareStockListsWithIsIn.
	
	6. use the new_stocks dataframe to 
	timeDelayPopulate each one.
	
	7. close the DB, commit all changes, and
