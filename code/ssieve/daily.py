        """
        Helper function which implements a 
        simple random timer to iteratively 
        udpate all stocks in the database.

        This function selects all stock 
        tickers from the database and 
        iterates over them using a random 
        timer for each iteration to avoid 
        slamming servers that provide the 
        stock data. It calls 
        getRecentMngStarPriceInfo() on each 
        stock.
        
        The timer is set to between 4-10 
        seconds and has been tested 
        successfully. The drawback is that 
        there are >5000 stocks to iterate 
        over. So once you invoke this function, 
        be prepared to work on another 
        project for some time. 
        
        This function will later implement 
        an async call to. It might be best 
        to deploy over a cloud infrastructure
        where each node could make only a 
        few requests.

        The argument 'stocks' is a PANDAS 
        dataframe to iterate over with the 
        columns 'Symbol' and 'Exchange', 
        although a series of just 'Symbol' 
        would also work.

        Returns a dictionary of the success 
        state of each {'Sym':'Update status'} 
        pair from getRecentMngStarPriceInfo().
